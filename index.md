Humans listen to music affectively. It's hard to describe the exact component in music that evokes a specific affective 
response in us. However, it is undeniable that a certain pattern exists, based on which we can state that a particular song 
evokes a particular emotion. This project aims to capture this pattern by using Machine Learning (Deep Learing, to be specific).
This project was done towards fulfilment of Bachelor of Engineering degree at University of Pune during my final year of 
undergraduate studies.

### Details coming soon!
